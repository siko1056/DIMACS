## Abstract:

To provide access to test problems for the participants of the 7th DIMACS
Implementation Challenge, we assembled a library of test problems.

Our main concerns in the selection were to create a library of instances that
- arise from the widest possible range of sources, and applications.
- are as realistic as possible.
- represent all levels of difficulty.
- have their origin and the formulation used clearly documented.

Currently, we have 12 problem sets.  More are welcome; please see the
[section below](#submissions).


## Developers:

- [Gabor Pataki](http://gaborpataki.web.unc.edu/) University of North Carolina,
  Chapel Hill
- [Stefan H. Schmieta](http://corc.ieor.columbia.edu/~schmieta) Columbia
  University


## Problem formats:

- The `.mat` files contain the problems in the format used by
  [Sedumi](http://www.unimaas.nl/~sturm/research.html)
  that solves a problem of the form

      min { c'x | st. Ax = b, x in K },

  where `K` is an appropriate cone, representing semidefinite, quadratic, and
  linear constraints on `x`; for details, see [the report][lib.pdf].  This
  format is probably the easiest to convert to all other formats, if you have
  Matlab.  For some large  graph problems, only a `.dat` file containing the
  graph description is available, with a commented Matlab code that can
  generate the `.mat` file from it.

- Two converter codes are provided below, both written by Brian Borchers.
  - [A Sedumi -> SDPpack converter in Matlab.](writesdp.m)
  - [An SDPpack -> SDPA converter in C](sqlptosdpa.c).


## Problem sets:

The [complete problem library][lib.tar.gz] as a `tar` file and compressed with
`gzip`.  [This table](http://dimacs.rutgers.edu/archive/Challenges/Seventh/Instances/tablecon.html)
lists the problem originators, formulators, and donators.  Read the
[preliminary technical report][lib.ps] ([PDF version][lib.pdf]) for more
details.

### The **torus** set: Max cut problems

from the Ising model of spin glasses.

**Caveat:** these `max { c'x | st. Ax = b, x in K }` type problems are given as
`min { -c'x | st. Ax = b, x in K }`.  To get the optimal values in the table,
you must multiply the optimal value of the latter problem by `-1`.
In addition, the optimal values of the `torusg` (that is, Gaussian instances)
must be divided by `100,000`.

- `gentorus.m`: commented Matlab file to make `.mat` from `.dat`-files

| fap36     | 8,448,105 | [1; 4,110] |      - | 8,405,931 | 63.7 `* (lb, not opt)` |
| fap-sup25 |   322,924 | [1; 2,118] |      - |   311,044 | 12.5 `(lb, not opt)`   |
| fap-sup36 | 1,154,467 | [1; 4,110] |      - | 1,112,293 | 63.7 `(lb, not opt)`   |

*Remark*: The `fap-sup` problems are relaxations of the corresponding `fap`
instances.  The difference is detailed in the [report][lib.pdf].

## Explanation of the tables above:

- An entry `[7; 3x5, 3, 4, 2x6 ]` in the "SDP" column means that the problem
  has `7` SDP blocks whose sizes are `5, 5, 5, 3, 4, 6, 6` in this order.
  The meaning of the entries in the "QUADR" column is analogous.

- If an entry in the "opt. value" column has is not accompanied by a mark, or
  remark, then it has been computed by a primal-dual interior point code.
  Currently these codes provide the most accurate solutions.

- If an entry is accompanied by the mark `*`, then it has been computed by a
  code designed to obtain approximate solutions to large scale problems
  (such as BMPR, BMZ, BUNDLE, and DSDP).

- If in addition to the `*` mark, there is a `lb, not opt` remark, this means
  that a lower bound on the objective value was computed by BMZ, or BUNDLE.
  These codes work with fully feasible dual solutions, whose value serves as a
  reliable lower bound, even when the termination criteria of the codes are
  not satisfied.

- Having a `(?)` mark means that the listed value is the currently known most
  accurate one; nevertheless, its accuracy is still not satisfactory, and the
  true value may be quite different.


## Reporting the solution quality:

We suggest the following data to be supplied with all computational results:
We are given the primal-dual pair of problems

    Min c'x         Max b'y
    st. x in K      st. z in K
        Ax = b          A^T y + z = c

where `K =K^*` is a direct product of semidefinite, quadratic, and nonnegative
cones. The best way to measure the error of a solution pair `( x, (y,z) )` is
calculating

1. the violation of the affine constraints normalized:

       norm(Ax - b)/(1+max(abs(b))), norm(A^T y + z - c)(1+max(abs(c)))

2. the violation of the conic constraints:

  For this purpose, we suggest computing `min(eigK(x))` and `min(eigK(z))` by
  using Sedumi's `eigK` function.

3. Some codes do not explicitly maintain `z`.  In this case, one should set

       z = c - A^T y

  Of course, then the violation as in i) will be zero (depending on the
  accuracy achieved by the computer).

4. Finally, the duality gap:

       max(0, c'*x - b'*y)

**IMPORTANT!** To make all error computations consistent, please use the

- Euclidean norms on vectors and
- Frobenius norms on matrices (which are then consistent).

Be careful not to simply use the Matlab `norm` function, since  that uses the
largest singular value of a matrix, which will be considerably smaller than its
Frobenius norm.
